# ml-classification-exercise-2
Another repository for trying out machine learning algorithms for classification. This is an exercise repository.
Script 0 analyses the dataset, and has been used for oversampling and undersampling the data creating new csv files when I tried to improve performances.
That's why there's that ugly commented code in the file.
Script 1 is for trying the different algorithms one at a time, while script 2 is to try kfold cross validation before classification (one algorithm at a time).
Script 3 generates learning curves for all algorithms and script 4 performs kfold cross validation and classification for all algorithms (those two might be slow on a laptop).
